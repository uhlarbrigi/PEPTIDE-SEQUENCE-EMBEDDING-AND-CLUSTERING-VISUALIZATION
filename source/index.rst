Welcome to ProtY's documentation!
=================================

This project is about using a pretrained protein transformer architecture to create embeddings
of various proteins, and then performing nonlinear dimensionality reduction on those embeddings
to see which kinds of similarities in protein function/structure we can restore.
After installing, you can use it as a pipeline, or you can use it function by function.
