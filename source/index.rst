Welcome to ProtY's documentation!
=================================
This project is about using a pretrained protein transformer architecture to create embeddings 
of various proteins, and then performing nonlinear dimensionality reduction on those embeddings 
to see which kinds of similarities in protein function/structure we can restore.
After installing, you can use it as a pipeline, or you can use it functiin by function.
