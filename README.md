# Peptide sequence embedding and clustering/visualization
The project is about using a pretrained protein transformer architecture to create embeddings of various proteins, and then performing nonlinear dimensionality reduction on those embeddings to see which kinds of similarities in protein function/structure we can restore.

## Installation
Install `ProtY` using pip

```
pip install ProtY
```

Clone the git repository
```
git clone https://github.com/uhlarbrigi/PEPTIDE-SEQUENCE-EMBEDDING-AND-CLUSTERING-VISUALIZATION.git
```

Change directory to the cloned repository
```
cd pyPCG-tooblox
```
Install with pip
```
pip install .
```

## Building the documentation
Install required packages
```
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```
Call Sphinx build command
```
sphinx-build -M html docs/source docs/build
```
On Windows you can also run the `make.bat` file
